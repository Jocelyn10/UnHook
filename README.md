If you are one of the rare breed of people who call themselves programmers, you must have faced the following sitation:

You were so busy working, that you forgot to take a break while coding... now your eyes hurt due to the excessive stress on them.

The solution? Use Un-Hook. An app that reminds you to take breaks at the right time.

## How to Use

1. Download and go to the repository location.
2. Install depenencies for main app using `npm install`
3. Go to front-end folder using `cd front-end` and use `npm install` to install front end realted dependencies.
4. Use `npm run start-front-end` to start the react app
5. Use `npm run dev` to start the electron app

## Tools/Frameworks Used

1. Electron
2. React
3. Redux (This is an overkill for such a small app, but I need to practice using redux + electron)
